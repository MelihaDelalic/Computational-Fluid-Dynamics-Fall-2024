# Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics FALL 2024 
In this repository, I present my academic papers completed for the Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics course in the Fall 2024 semester. The objective of these projects is to understand flow behavior under turbulent conditions.

## Included Papers 
- Fully Developed Turbulent Channel Flows
- External Aerodynamics of a Car

In the first paper, I explore RANS turbulence modeling and compare the simulation results with DNS data. The study also examines the impact of near-wall mesh refinement, 
analyzing the differences between using a Wall Function and direct integration. Additionally, various channel geometries and flow conditions have been investigated to highlight the role of boundary conditions, their purpose, and when to use them. 
Finally, flow separation and its effect on the velocity boundary layer have been thoroughly explained.

The study of the external aerodynamics of a car has provided valuable insights into drag and lift coefficients and their impact on overall vehicle efficiency. 
Furthermore, pressure and velocity fields have been visualized using streamlines, allowing for the identification of high- and low-pressure zones around the car.

## Tools and Softwares
- T-Flows - CFD analysis of turbulent flow in various channels
- SimFlow - External aerodynamics simulation for a car
- Paraview - Postprocessing: visualization, interpretation and data extraction
